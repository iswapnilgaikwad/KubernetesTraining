//Assigment 3

Firstly i will give command "kubectl get svc" and then check whether NodePort is present or clusterIp is there.
If it is clusterIp then i Will change it to NodePort by giving command

  -->  kubectl edit service NAME_OF_SERVICE 

(As the application is already deployed, we should not change it by changing in yaml file manually).


If it is still not working, then i will check if the port which i have specified is used by any other application. 
if yes, then i will change port of another application to any other port.

If it still not works  will try deleting the pod and re deploying them.
