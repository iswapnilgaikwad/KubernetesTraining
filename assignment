~command- kubectl get svc

NodePort for result app was 10.106.66.38 and port number was 31001
NodePort for voting app was 10.104.220.63 and port number was 31000

~command- kubectl get po
For both result and vote apps, single containers were created each

//8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.


~commmand- kubectl delete po POD_NAME

After deleting the voting pod , a new pod was created same for other pods also.

The result pod stopped working after deleting the db pod.

For making the result pod working-
When result pod is deleted, a new pod  got created and the application started working fine.

*A new pod gets created because of replica set. (If we specify 3 replicas in replicaset yaml file, then it will keep three pods. i.e. If 2 pod is deleted, 2 will created.. It will maintain 3 pods in this case )
